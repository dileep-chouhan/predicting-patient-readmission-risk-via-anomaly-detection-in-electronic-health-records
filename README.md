# Predicting Patient Readmission Risk via Anomaly Detection in Electronic Health Records

**Overview:**

This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying patients at high risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge using anomaly detection techniques applied to electronic health records (EHRs).  The analysis focuses on identifying unusual patterns in patient data that may indicate a higher likelihood of readmission, enabling proactive interventions and optimized resource allocation within the healthcare system.  The model leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze various patient features and flag those at elevated risk.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`


**Example Output:**

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including summary statistics and model performance metrics.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., plots showing the distribution of key features, model performance curves) in the `output` directory.  These visualizations aid in understanding the model's performance and the characteristics of high-risk patients.  The exact filenames and contents of the output will depend on the specific data and model used.


**Data:**

*(Optional: Add a section describing the data used, its source, and any preprocessing steps)*  For example:  "The project utilizes a synthetic dataset generated to mimic real-world EHR data.  The data includes features such as age, diagnosis codes, length of stay, and lab results.  Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values and one-hot encoding categorical variables."


**Future Work:**

*(Optional: Add a section outlining potential future improvements or extensions to the project)* For example: "Future work could involve exploring alternative anomaly detection algorithms, incorporating additional data sources (e.g., social determinants of health), and developing a user-friendly interface for visualizing and interpreting the model's predictions."
